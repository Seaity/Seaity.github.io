  <h1>About Seaity</h1>
  <p>
    Seaity is an application developed by the Seaity Capstone Group at the
    United States Coast Guard Academy. It is intended to assist cadets at
    reviewing the Rules of the Road for vessels on water by using virtual
    reality.
  </p>
  <h2>Thesis</h2>
  <p>
    While underway, graduates of the United States Coast Guard Academy who
    become cutterman are expected to make quick decisions in line with the Rules
    of the Road (ROTR) during high stress evolutions. Seaityâ€™s goal is to bring
    visually realistic waterway scenarios to cadets in the classroom, to produce
    future officers who are more comfortable, confident, and knowledgeable on
    the water. Seaity has achieved this goal by developing a virtual reality
    application that runs on the Meta Quest 2, an inexpensive and easy to use
    stand-alone virtual reality headset. In the application, users can choose
    from a variety of ROTR scenarios and work through them in virtual reality.
    As of right now the product is rather rudimentary, the user answers
    questions and is then shown the correct action of the vessel, but this can
    be greatly expanded upon in the future. Future versions may contain more
    scenarios to choose from, give the user more control over the scenario,
    combine multiple scenarios into one complex one, and give end users the
    ability to create unique levels from within the app.
